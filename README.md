With the alliance of emerging high-throughput methods, data generated by the flourishing field of environmental microbiology is escalating in unprecedented speed and diversity. Facing the surfeit of data, it rises as a major problem that how individual researchers access and interpret them. With a platform managing the collection contributed by the ENIGMA teams and a versatile toolbox at hand, one can readily mine through the data and share them with others, which could expedite the process of scientific research in this field.

With these in mind, we built a web-based browser integrating the isolates information and growth curves of different strains under various conditions. Key features of the browser include indexing the collection by strain, taxonomy, campaign, etc., retrieving the 16s sequences in a hierarchical structure, instant BLASTing against multiple databases, customized plotting of the growth data and interacting with the website via APIs. The browser enables individual researchers to conveniently locate the information of interest and serves as a functional and expandable infrastructure of the ENGMA initiative as a whole.
